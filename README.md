# rrule_nim

Nim implementation of the rrule npm package - A library for working with
recurrence rules for calendar dates as defined in the iCalendar RFC.

This modules is not meant to compile to JS. It is not a set of bindings for the
rrule library; it is a re-implementation in nim. If you want to compile to JS,
I recommend just using the rrule npm package.
